Stuck on counter and drink duty..no tips because customers are too cheap. Carhops are paid way more. I signed up for that but it was only given to veterans. Unrealistic expectations for closing on time. As front of house you clean the restaurant part the bathrooms and are still expected to serve customers until 9 00pm..it gets dirty again just silly. Some unrealistic time for getting your duty done and yet u still get wrote up. Why even clean well You might as well work half butt. Most of my writeups were for this. How does 1 person do everything for the front while the carhops get to work more as a team at closing time. Little odd how they run it. I worked at sonic and was only given 1 write up in 8 months and not for cleaning up at the end..just amateur. Here 6 in 2 months. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. I HIGHLY don t recommend working if you re considered cheap labor like I was. Got hired somewhere else knowing I was gonna be fired eventually. There is literally no business in the restaurant only outside. They re looking for the cheapest labor but they are the quickest to be written up. Other restaurants truly value their lowest paid workers. Beware do not work here!\"\"',\n",
